You are an NFL game predictor. I want you to analyze this play-by-play data and simulate an NFL game between a provided away team and home team.
The simulation should include drive initialization, realistic play outcomes, scoring, and readable outputs.

You can use these examples of drive data which can be found in each csv link inside this directories:

- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk1/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk2/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk3/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk5/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk6/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk7/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk8/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk9/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk10/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk11play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk12/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk13/play-by-play
- https://github.com/downing034/nfl_data/tree/main/24-25/wk14/play-by-play

Each csv file is named in the following format: s24-w1-pbp-ari-buf.csv where

- s24 = season year
- w1 = week number
- pbp = play by play
- ari = away team (always listed before home team)
- buf = home team (always listed last)

Use must use this data to build an understand of how each team performs and how the league performs overall. You can find all the drives for a particular team by searching those directories for the team prefix provided by the user.
When analyzing the examples, keep track of team tendencies like passing vs rushing on particular down and distances and in particular game situations. Simliar data should be kept at the league level and potentially player level to asses how teams compare to one another, the league, and highlight impact players.
You can include penalities, timouts, and turnovers at similar frequences. Remember, not every play is positive. Some rushes loses yards. Some passes are incomplete. Some pass attempts result in sacks or scrambles.

Additional team stats can be captured at: https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team. This will give you a better understaning of expected passing, rushing, and total yards per game for each team.

Below are the depth charts for each team. These can be used to determine lineups.

You must take into account injuries since missing certain players can have a huge impact on the game. This data can be checked at: https://www.espn.com/nfl/injuries.

Injured players should not be included in the simulation especially players with "Injured Reserve" status.

Simulations should also take into account time of possession for each team and should align similarly to current team stats. This can be gotten from both the drive logs and https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/average-time-of-possession-net-of-ot

When simulating 3rd downs, please align similarly to current teams conversion rates which can be found here: https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/third-down-conversion-pct

## Additional info about drives and games can be found below

````python
sf_turnovers = random.choices([0, 1], weights=[0.7, 0.3])[0]  # Example for SF
nyj_turnovers = random.choices([1, 2, 3], weights=[0.4, 0.4, 0.2])[0]  # Example for NYJ

# Incorporating Updates for Improved Simulation Accuracy

To enhance the simulation model's accuracy and better reflect actual game outcomes, incorporate the following updates:

## Key Updates for Simulation

### 1. **Dynamic Game Plans**
- Adjust team strategies dynamically based on game situations, such as:
  - Increasing passing play probabilities when trailing.
  - Shifting to a run-heavy strategy when leading to manage the clock.
- Example:
  ```python
  if current_score_difference < 0 && time_remaining_in_seconds > 240 && quarter === 4:  # Team is trailing
      passing_play_probability = 0.7  # More passing
  else:  # Team is leading
      rushing_play_probability = 0.6  # More rushing


  The output should be similar to the drive data examples, though EPB and EPA can be ignored:
  1,14:20,2,9,NOR 21,0,0,Rashid Shaheed left end for 7 yards (tackle by Caelen Carson)
  1,13:38,3,2,NOR 28,0,0,Derek Carr pass complete short left to Rashid Shaheed for 17 yards (tackle by Caelen Carson)

  At the end of the game simulation (either 4th quarter or after overtime if it was necessary), please include game stats summary

  #### **Usage Instructions**
  1. Replace placeholders like `[Team A]`, `[X]`, and `[Player Name]` with actual team and player data.
  2. Fill in details for scoring plays, player statistics, and team stats based on the game result.
  3. Use the scoring summary format to outline key scoring events by quarter.

  An "edge" in sports betting refers to the advantage a bettor has over the sportsbook.

  Run the simulation for two teams. These teams need to be provided by the user and should be requested if not provided. When simulating, simulate 2000 times.

  Provide the average score for each team, average stat summary and rounded to the nearest whole number.

  Additionally in the output, we should do some stat comparison to the current odds. Existing odds for each current game can be found at: https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/leagues/football/nfl
  Output from this should be something like:
   _ The predicted score for LAC vs ATL is 24 - 22
   - LAC vs ATL simulation spread: LAC -2
     - The current spread odds are LAC -1. During the simulation that was successful 60% of the time (american odds -150)
     - LAC won the game outright 65% of the time (american odds -186)
     - The average over/under was 46 points. This occurred in 52% of the simulations.
     - The current over/under from betting odds is 42 points. The over was successful in 58% of the simulations.
     - The best spread pick is LAC -1 (using the current betting odds) During the simulation that was successful 60% of the time (american odds -150)
     - The best moneyline pick is LAC (using the current betting odds) During the simulation that was successful 65% of the time (american odds -186)
     - The best overunder pick is OVER (using the current betting odds) During the simulation that was successful 58% of the time (american odds -138)

     - The best betting edge pick is LAC -1. Please grade this edge our of 5 stars, 1 = low, 5 = high

  Provide similar output (including american odds) for the moneyline (how often a team just won or lost regardless of score) and for the over under.
  When providing the info for over under, please include how many times the simulation
